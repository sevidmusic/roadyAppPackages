    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/sevidmusic/roady">Roady</a> is a tool designed
        to aid in the development of websites.
    </p>

    <p>
        Its design allows the features of a website to be implemented as
        smaller niche applications called Apps.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/sevidmusic/roady">Roady</a> Apps are responsible for implementing one or more related features.
    </p>

    <p>
        The features of an App can be made available to multiple websites running on
        a single installation of the <a href="https://github.com/sevidmusic/roady">Roady</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apps can configure output to show up in response to appropriate requests to a
        website, and can also provide stylesheets, scripts, and other resources
        necessary to implement the specific features they provide.
